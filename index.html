                <h2>Types of sessions we provide:</h2>
                <button class="accordion">Hatha yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. In the West,
                        hatha yoga simply refers
                        to all the other styles of yoga (ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are grounded in a physical
                        practice. However, there are
                        other branches of yoga such as kriya, raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the
                        physical-based yoga practice. The
                        physical-based yoga is the most popular and has numerous styles.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Iyengar yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Iyengar yoga was founded by B.K.S. Iyengar and focuses on alignment as well as detailed and
                        precise movements. In an
                        Iyengar class, students perform a variety of postures while controlling the breath.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Kundalini yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Kundalini yoga practice is equal parts spiritual and physical. This style is all about releasing
                        the kundalini
                        energy in
                        your body said to be trapped, or coiled, in the lower spine.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Ashtanga yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>In Sanskrit, ashtanga is translated as "Eight Limb path." In Mysore, India, people gather to
                        practice this form of yoga
                        together at their own pace—if you see Mysore-led ashtanga, it's expected of you to know the
                        series. Vinyasa yoga stems
                        from ashtanga as the flowing style linking breath to movement.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Vinyasa yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Vinyasa means "to place in a special way" and, in this case, yoga postures. Vinyasa is the most
                        athletic yoga style.
                        Vinyasa was adapted from ashtanga yoga in the 1980s. Many types of yoga can also be considered
                        vinyasa flows such as
                        ashtanga, power yoga, and prana.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Bikram yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Bikram yoga is named after Bikram Choudhury and features a sequence of set poses in a sauna-like
                        room—typically set to
                        105 degrees and 40% humidity. Choudhury faced sexual assault and harassment lawsuits in the U.S.
                        and fled to Mexico in
                        2017. Many studios that were formerly Bikram now practice hot yoga, in an effort to disassociate
                        with the founder.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Yin yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Yin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with seated postures that are held for longer periods of
                        time. Yin can also be a
                        meditative yoga practice that helps you find inner peace.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Restorative yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Restorative yoga focuses on winding down after a long day and relaxing your mind. At its core,
                        this style focuses on
                        body relaxation. Restorative yoga also helps to cleanse and free your mind.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Prenatal yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Prenatal yoga is carefully adapted for "moms to be" and is tailored to women in all trimesters.
                        Many have said that
                        prenatal is one of the best types of exercise for expectant moms because of the pelvic floor
                        work, focus on breathing,
                        and bonding with the growing baby; prenatal yoga also helps mothers prepare for labor and
                        delivery. I also practiced my
                        own form of prenatal yoga during both of my pregnancies.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Anusara yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Anusara is a modern-day version of hatha yoga, most similar to vinyasa in that it focuses on
                        alignment, but with
                        more
                        focus on the mind-body-heart connection. It was founded by John Friend who created a unique
                        system called the
                        Universal
                        Principals of Alignment. He resigned in 2012 after accusations of sexual misconduct and
                        financial mismanagement.
                        Friend
                        has since partnered with Desi and Micah Springer to teach the Bowspring method.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Jivamukti yoga</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Jivamukti was founded in 1984 by Sharon Ganon and David Life. Jivamukti is mainly
                        vinyasa-flow-style classes infused
                        with Hindu spiritual teachings. At its core, this style emphasizes connection to Earth as a
                        living being, so most
                        Jivamukti devotees follow their vegetarian philosophy.</p>
