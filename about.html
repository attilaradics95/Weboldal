                <p class="about">
                    Our yoga classes provide movement for health and relaxation, but are also designed to promote
                    greater
                    self-awareness and
                    inner peace. At The Yoga Place and Yoga Central we have a full spectrum of yoga programs to help
                    improve
                    strength,
                    flexibility and posture but, even more importantly, yoga is a holistic and spiritual practice where
                    we
                    work on
                    integration of mind, body and spirit. We provide a safe haven where you are warmly welcome and where
                    you
                    can work on
                    personal development or just relax and experience the joy of yoga. We want to help you help
                    yourself.

                    Don't limit your ideas about yoga. The joy of yoga shines brighter when we allow it to be many
                    things.
                    Yoga is balance,
                    it is health, it is relaxation, it is transformation, it is the opening of new possibilities, it is
                    community and much
                    more.

                        <p> From the time he was young, Dylan had a passion for finding the obstacles to other’s
                            happiness and helping them to clear
                            them away. Breathwork, Meditation, and Asana found their way into Dylan’s life at a young
                            age and provided a framework
                            for approaching deeper levels of awareness. Since 2013 Dylan has been sharing a variety of
                            practices to help others
                            release their collected fears in order to experience deeper levels of happiness on their
                            journeys to awareness.</p>
